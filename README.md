# DSA Learning Journey with Python

Welcome to my GitHub repository where I document my daily progress in learning **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** using Python.

## Overview

This repository is my learning log where I push daily progress related to various DSA topics. The aim is to master essential algorithms and data structures while improving my problem-solving skills in Python. Each topic is accompanied by code examples, problem solutions, and explanations.

## Why DSA?

Data Structures and Algorithms form the foundation for writing efficient and optimized code. They are essential for:
- Building efficient software systems.
- Solving complex problems systematically.
- Preparing for technical interviews (especially at companies like FAANG).

## Topics Covered

I will explore and document the following topics (and more) as I progress:

1. **Arrays**
   - Basic operations
   - Searching and Sorting
   - Two-pointer technique
2. **Linked Lists**
   - Singly and Doubly Linked Lists
   - Operations (Insert, Delete, Reverse)
3. **Stacks and Queues**
   - Stack operations (push, pop)
   - Queue operations (enqueue, dequeue)
4. **Hashing**
   - Hash tables
   - Collision handling
5. **Trees**
   - Binary Trees
   - Binary Search Trees (BST)
   - Tree traversals (Inorder, Preorder, Postorder)
6. **Graphs**
   - BFS (Breadth First Search)
   - DFS (Depth First Search)
   - Shortest path algorithms (Dijkstraâ€™s, Bellman-Ford)
7. **Recursion and Backtracking**
8. **Dynamic Programming (DP)**
   - Top-down and Bottom-up approaches
   - Common DP problems
9. **Greedy Algorithms**
10. **Sorting Algorithms**
    - Merge Sort, Quick Sort, Heap Sort
11. **Searching Algorithms**
    - Binary Search
